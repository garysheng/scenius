# Voice Anonymization System

## Overview
Scenius provides voice anonymization features for users who want to participate in audio discussions while maintaining their privacy. This is particularly valuable for anonymous users ("anons") in the web3 and crypto space who want to contribute voice notes without revealing their identity.

## Implementation Progress

### Core Features
- [ ] Real-time voice modulation
- [ ] Multiple voice filter options
- [ ] Voice preset saving
- [ ] Voice preset sharing
- [ ] Background noise reduction
- [ ] Voice quality preservation

### Voice Filters
- [ ] Pitch shifting
- [ ] Formant manipulation
- [ ] Voice gender neutralization
- [ ] Accent neutralization
- [ ] Custom filter creation
- [ ] Filter combination support

### Privacy Features
- [ ] Client-side processing
- [ ] Metadata stripping
- [ ] Original audio deletion
- [ ] Voice fingerprint masking
- [ ] Anti-voice-recognition measures

## Technical Implementation

### Voice Processing Pipeline
```typescript
interface VoiceProcessingConfig {
  filters: {
    pitch: {
      shift: number;      // semitones, -12 to +12
      preserve: boolean;  // preserve formants
    };
    formant: {
      shift: number;     // scale factor, 0.5 to 2.0
      width: number;     // formant width modification
    };
    effects: {
      reverb: boolean;
      chorus: boolean;
      distortion: number;
    };
  };
  privacy: {
    stripMetadata: boolean;
    maskFingerprint: boolean;
    addNoise: number;     // subtle noise to prevent reconstruction
  };
  quality: {
    sampleRate: number;
    bitDepth: number;
    compression: 'none' | 'lossy' | 'lossless';
  };
}
```

### Voice Presets
```typescript
interface VoicePreset {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  config: VoiceProcessingConfig;
  tags: string[];
  isPublic: boolean;
  createdBy: string;
  usageCount: number;
}
```

## User Experience

### Recording Flow
1. User initiates voice recording
2. Selects voice preset or configures custom filters
3. Real-time preview of voice modulation
4. Option to adjust settings during recording
5. Final review before sending
6. Processed audio is sent and original is discarded

### Preset Management
- Save personal presets
- Browse public preset library
- Rate and review presets
- Share presets with space members
- Create preset collections

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Security
- All processing happens client-side
- No original audio is stored
- No voice fingerprints are saved
- Metadata is stripped before upload

### Anti-Reconstruction Measures
- Multiple layered filters
- Subtle noise injection
- Formant scrambling
- Pitch randomization
- Timing variations

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] AI-powered voice anonymization
- [ ] Advanced accent neutralization
- [ ] Emotion preservation while anonymizing
- [ ] Voice style transfer
- [ ] Custom filter creation tools
- [ ] Collaborative preset creation
- [ ] Voice anonymity strength scoring
- [ ] Anti-reconstruction verification
- [ ] Batch processing for existing recordings
- [ ] Integration with popular voice changers
